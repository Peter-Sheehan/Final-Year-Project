HIGH,34,BP9166D7E9,WORKDIR,Required pattern not found: Checks if WORKDIR uses an absolute path.,Use absolute paths when setting the WORKDIR. Replace RUN cd commands with WORKDIR instructions to improve readability and maintainability.,RUN cd /app && \
HIGH,35,BP2AA02452,Create ephemeral containers,"Required keyword(s) ('ENV', 'ARG') not found. Check for the use of ENV or ARG instructions to support configuration at runtime, which is a characteristic of ephemeral containers.","Design your containers to be stateless: externalize data storage, use environment variables for configuration, and ensure containers can be easily replaced. Review application architecture to ensure it supports these principles.",    mkdir temp 
HIGH,35,BP8E7F00CF,FROM,Required pattern not found: Check if the Dockerfile is using Alpine as a base image.,Use Alpine image as the base image when possible for its small size and security benefits. Avoid using the 'latest' tag to ensure your builds are predictable and consistent.,    mkdir temp 
LOW,35,BP64B8A7E2,LABEL,Required pattern not found: Checks for LABEL instructions with properly quoted key-value pairs.,Ensure that each LABEL instruction uses properly quoted key-value pairs. Combine multiple labels into a single instruction where possible to reduce layers. Avoid unescaped inner quote characters in labels.,    mkdir temp 
HIGH,35,BPAD173E04,RUN,Required pattern not found: RUN command split across multiple lines using backslashes.,"Ensure RUN instructions are readable and maintainable by splitting long commands across multiple lines, combining apt-get update and install in the same RUN statement, avoiding the use of || which can ignore errors, and using set -o pipefail to catch errors in pipes.",    mkdir temp 
INFO,35,BP4FB971F0,EXPOSE,Required pattern not found: Checks if there is at least one EXPOSE instruction with a numeric port.,"Ensure you are using the EXPOSE instruction to indicate the port your application listens on. Use the common, traditional port for your application. For example, use 'EXPOSE 80' for Apache web server images.",    mkdir temp 
MEDIUM,35,BP086BFB42,ENV,Required pattern not found: Check for the presence of ENV instruction updating the PATH environment variable.,"Use ENV to set the PATH and other environment variables needed for your container. Consider consolidating ENV instructions where possible to reduce layers. For version management, use ENV to define version numbers, making updates easier. Ensure any environment variables set with ENV that need to be unset are handled correctly in a RUN instruction to avoid leaving unwanted values in layers.",    mkdir temp 
INFO,35,BP4F995E92,ADD or COPY,Required pattern not found: ADD instruction is used for downloading remote files.,Prefer using COPY for copying files from the build context or another stage in a multi-stage build. Use ADD for remote files or automatic tar extraction. Consider using bind mounts for temporary file inclusion during build.,    mkdir temp 
HIGH,35,BPFAEF57A2,ENTRYPOINT,Required pattern not found: Check for the presence of the ENTRYPOINT instruction.,Ensure your Dockerfile includes an ENTRYPOINT instruction to define the container's main command. Use CMD to provide default flags. Consider using a helper script with ENTRYPOINT for complex setups.,    mkdir temp 
MEDIUM,35,BPDE4F1AAB,VOLUME,Required keyword(s) ('VOLUME') not found. Check if the VOLUME instruction is used at least once.,"Ensure that the VOLUME instruction is used to expose any database storage area, configuration storage, or files/folders created by your Docker container. Review the Dockerfile reference for the VOLUME instruction for best practices.",    mkdir temp 
HIGH,35,BP6EB0C612,USER,Disallowed keyword(s) ('sudo') found. Check for the presence of 'sudo' which should be avoided.,"Ensure that your Dockerfile specifies a non-root user for running the service by using the USER instruction. Avoid using 'sudo' due to its unpredictable behavior in containers. If necessary, use 'gosu' for privilege escalation tasks. Do not frequently switch users with the USER instruction to keep the Dockerfile simple and reduce layers.",    mkdir temp 
HIGH,35,BP9166D7E9,WORKDIR,Required pattern not found: Checks if WORKDIR uses an absolute path.,Use absolute paths when setting the WORKDIR. Replace RUN cd commands with WORKDIR instructions to improve readability and maintainability.,    mkdir temp
