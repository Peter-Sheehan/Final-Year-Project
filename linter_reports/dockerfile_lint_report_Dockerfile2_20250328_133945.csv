Also, avoid frequently switching users to reduce complexity and potential security risks.",    mkdir temp 
HIGH,35,BP9166D7E9,WORKDIR,Required pattern not found: Checks if WORKDIR uses an absolute path.,Use WORKDIR with absolute paths to set the working directory. Replace any 'RUN cd' commands with WORKDIR instructions for better readability and maintainability.,    mkdir temp 
MEDIUM,35,BPAD173E04,RUN,Required pattern not found: Checks if RUN commands are split across multiple lines using backslashes.,"Ensure complex or long RUN commands are split across multiple lines for readability. Use backslashes to continue commands on a new line and chain commands with '&&'. For package installations, always combine 'apt-get update' with 'apt-get install' in the same RUN statement to avoid caching issues. Consider using version pinning for packages to ensure the build retrieves a specific version.",    mkdir temp

Check if the VOLUME instruction is used at least once.,"Ensure that your Dockerfile includes at least one VOLUME instruction to expose mutable or user-serviceable parts of your image, such as database storage areas or configuration files. Review the Dockerfile reference for the VOLUME instruction for more details.",    mkdir temp 
HIGH,35,BPFAEF57A2,ENTRYPOINT,Required pattern not found: Checks if the ENTRYPOINT instruction is used.,"Ensure that ENTRYPOINT is used to set the main command of the image, allowing it to be run as if it was that command. Use CMD to provide default flags. Consider using a helper script with ENTRYPOINT for complex setups.",    mkdir temp
