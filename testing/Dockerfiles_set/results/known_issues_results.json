    "### Explanation of Changes:",
    "",
    "1. **Specific Base Image Version**:",
    "   - Changed `FROM python:latest` to `FROM python:3.10-slim-buster`.",
    "   - Addresses Linter Issue: Avoid using the latest tag, prefer specific versions.",
    "   - Benefits: Ensures consistent builds and utilizes a smaller base image with fewer vulnerabilities.",
    "",
    "2. **Consolidate RUN Commands**:",
    "   - Combined `apt-get update` and `apt-get install` into a single `RUN` instruction with `--no-install-recommends`.",
    "   - Addresses Linter Issues: Separate update and install commands; suggest `--no-install-recommends`.",
    "   - Benefits: Reduces image size, layers, and build time, and avoids installing unnecessary packages.",
    "",
    "3. **Use COPY over ADD**:",
    "   - Replaced `ADD . /app` with `COPY . /app`.",
    "   - Addresses Linter Issue: Recommended to use `COPY` unless specific functionalities of `ADD` are needed.",
    "   - Benefits: COPY is more explicit and predictable for copying files from the build context.",
    "",
    "4. **Remove Unnecessary Commands and Comments**:",
    "   - Removed `RUN mkdir /data && cd /data`, which didn't have a meaningful role in the final image setup.",
    "   - Removed the unused and unset `ENV BAD_VAR=`.",
    "   - Addresses Linter Issue: Avoid ephemeral data directories; ensure ENV is not empty.",
    "   - Benefits: Simplifies the Dockerfile and avoids creating unnecessary directories/layers.",
    "",
    "5. **Create and Use Non-Root User**:",
    "   - Added commands to create a non-root user and switched to it with `USER appuser`.",
    "   - Addresses Linter Issues: Avoid running as the root user.",
    "   - Benefits: Improves security by minimizing privileges within the container.",
    "",
    "6. **Refactor CMD Instruction**:",
    "   - Reformulated `CMD` to `[\"python\", \"app.py\"]`.",
    "   - Addresses Linter Issue: Run one process per container; use JSON array syntax for CMD.",
    "   - Benefits: More reliable command execution (doesn't spawn a shell), adhering to best practices for container operations.",
    "",
    "7. **Add LABEL Metadata**:",
    "   - Added labels for maintainer and description.",
    "   - Best Practice: Use labels to provide metadata for easier management and documentation.",
    "   - Benefits: Helps in organizing and managing the image, providing contact info and purpose details."
