    "### Explanation of Changes:",
    "1. **Pinned specific version of the base image**:",
    "   - Changed `FROM ubuntu:latest` to `FROM ubuntu:22.04`.",
    "   - Addresses the linter issue by defining a specific version of Ubuntu for stability and predictable rebuilds.",
    "   - This helps prevent vulnerabilities and ensure that the environment is consistent every time it's built.",
    "",
    "2. **Combined and optimized RUN instructions**:",
    "   - Combined all `RUN` instructions into one command with `apt-get update`, `apt-get install`, `pip3 install`, and cleanup of cache.",
    "   - Added `--no-install-recommends` to minimize unnecessary packages.",
    "   - Addresses multiple linter warnings by reducing the number of layers, clearing the apt cache to reduce image size, and ensuring that installations are not cached unnecessarily.",
    "   - This reduces the image size and ensures that the packages are updated right before use.",
    "",
    "3. **Changed ADD to COPY**:",
    "   - Replaced `ADD . /app` with `COPY . /app`.",
    "   - Addresses the linter warning and follows best practices as `COPY` is more appropriate for local file copy operations.",
    "   - This makes the intent clearer and avoids any surprises that can occur with `ADD`.",
    "",
    "4. **Implemented non-root user**:",
    "   - Added a `RUN` command to create a user named `appuser` and then used `USER appuser`.",
    "   - Addresses the critical linter issue by dropping root privileges during runtime.",
    "   - This enhances security by minimizing the impact of a potential compromise.",
    "",
    "5. **Sorted and pinned versions in RUN command**:",
    "   - Listed the `apt-get` packages alphabetically, clearly version-pinned where applicable.",
    "   - This addresses best practices for readability and maintenance, ensuring low chances of unexpected updates causing breaking changes.",
    "",
    "These changes overall are aimed at creating a more stable, smaller, and secure image by addressing common pitfalls in Dockerfile authoring."
