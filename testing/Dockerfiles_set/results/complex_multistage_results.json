    "### Explanation of Changes:",
    "",
    "1. **Switch Base Image to Slim Variant**",
    "   - Changed both base images from `python:3.9` to `python:3.9-slim`.",
    "   - **Addresses**: Linter's high-security issue.",
    "   - **Benefits**: The slim variant reduces the image size by omitting unnecessary components while maintaining compatibility and security, decreasing the attack surface.",
    "",
    "2. **Sorting and Cleanup of `RUN` Commands**",
    "   - Sorted and cleaned up `RUN` command by listing package names alphabetically and removing installation cache.",
    "   - **Addresses**: Best practices of sorting multi-line arguments.",
    "   - **Benefits**: Increases readability and maintainability, and reduces the image size by removing unnecessary files.",
    "",
    "3. **User and Permissions Setup**",
    "   - Modified the creation of the `appuser` to include a group and added a `chown` to secure the `/app` directory.",
    "   - **Addresses**: The best practice of using non-root users and securing file permissions.",
    "   - **Benefits**: Enhances container security by ensuring the application runs under a non-root user and only has access to necessary files.",
    "",
    "By applying the above improvements, the Docker image becomes smaller, more secure, and more maintainable, while adhering to established Docker best practices."
