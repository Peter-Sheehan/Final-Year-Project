Docker only needs to build the common stage once. This means that your derivative images use memory on the Docker host more efficiently and load more quickly. It's also easier to maintain a common base stage (\"Don't repeat yourself\"), than it is to have multiple different stages doing similar things."

When you pick your base image, look out for the badges indicating that the image is part of these programs. When building your own image from a Dockerfile, ensure you choose a minimal base image that matches your requirements. A smaller base image not only offers portability and fast downloads, but also shrinks the size of your image and minimizes the number of vulnerabilities introduced through the dependencies. You should also consider using two types of base image: one for building and unit testing, and another (typically slimmer) image for production. In the later stages of development, your image may not require build tools such as compilers, build systems, and debugging tools. A small image with minimal dependencies can considerably lower the attack surface."

To ensure that you're getting the latest versions of dependencies in your build, you can use the--no-cacheoption to avoid cache hits. The following Dockerfile uses the24.04tag of theubuntuimage. Over time, that tag may resolve to a different underlying version of theubuntuimage, as the publisher rebuilds the image with new security patches and updated libraries.

Limiting each container to one process is a good rule of thumb, but it's not a hard and fast rule. For example, not only can containers bespawned with an init process, some programs might spawn additional processes of their own accord. For instance,Celerycan spawn multiple worker processes, andApachecan create one process per request. Use your best judgment to keep containers as clean and modular as possible.

        "title": "Pin base image versions",
        "description": "Image tags are mutable, meaning a publisher can update a tag to point to a new image. This is useful because it lets publishers update tags to point to newer versions of an image. And as an image consumer, it means you automatically get the new version when you re-build your image. For example, if you specifyFROM alpine:3.19in your Dockerfile,3.19resolves to the latest patch version for3.19. At one point in time, the3.19tag might point to version 3.19.1 of the image. If you rebuild the image 3 months later, the same tag might point to a different version, such as 3.19.4. This publishing workflow is best practice, and most publishers use this tagging strategy, but it isn't enforced. The downside with this is that you're not guaranteed to get the same for every build. This could result in breaking changes, and it means you also don't have an audit trail of the exact image versions that you're using. To fully secure your supply chain integrity, you can pin the image version to a specific digest. By pinning your images to a digest, you're guaranteed to always use the same image version, even if a publisher replaces the tag with a new image. For example, the following Dockerfile pins the Alpine image to the same tag as earlier,3.19, but this time with a digest reference as well. With this Dockerfile, even if the publisher updates the3.19tag, your builds would still use the pinned image version:13b7e62e8df80264dbb747995705a986aa530415763a6c58f84a3ca8af9a5bcd. While this helps you avoid unexpected changes, it's also more tedious to have to look up and include the image digest for base image versions manually each time you want to update it. And you're opting out of automated security fixes, which is likely something you want to get. Docker Scout's defaultUp-to-Date Base Imagespolicychecks whether the base image version you're using is in fact the latest version. This policy also checks if pinned digests in your Dockerfile correspond to the correct version. If a publisher updates an image that you've pinned, the policy evaluation returns a non-compliant status, indicating that you should update your image. Docker Scout also supports an automated remediation workflow for keeping your base images up-to-date. When a new image digest is available, Docker Scout can automatically raise a pull request on your repository to update your Dockerfiles to use the latest version. This is better than using a tag that changes the version automatically, because you're in control and you have an audit trail of when and how the change occurred.

By default, backslash escapes a newline character, but you can change it with theescapedirective. You can also use here documents to run multiple commands without chaining them with a pipeline operator: For more information aboutRUN, seeDockerfile reference for the RUN instruction. One common use case forRUNinstructions in Debian-based images is to install software usingapt-get. Becauseapt-getinstalls packages, theRUN apt-getcommand has several counter-intuitive behaviors to look out for. Always combineRUN apt-get updatewithapt-get installin the sameRUNstatement. For example: Usingapt-get updatealone in aRUNstatement causes caching issues and subsequentapt-get installinstructions to fail. For example, this issue will occur in the following Dockerfile: After building the image, all layers are in the Docker cache. Suppose you later modifyapt-get installby adding an extra package as shown in the following Dockerfile: Docker sees the initial and modified instructions as identical and reuses the cache from previous steps. As a result theapt-get updateisn't executed because the build uses the cached version. Because theapt-get updateisn't run, your build can potentially get an outdated version of thecurlandnginxpackages. UsingRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommendsensures your Dockerfile installs the latest package versions with no further coding or manual intervention. This technique is known as cache busting. You can also achieve cache busting by specifying a package version. This is known as version pinning. For example: Version pinning forces the build to retrieve a particular version regardless of what’s in the cache. This technique can also reduce failures due to unanticipated changes in required packages. Below is a well-formedRUNinstruction that demonstrates all theapt-getrecommendations. Thes3cmdargument specifies a version1.1.*. If the image previously used an older version, specifying the new one causes a cache bust ofapt-get updateand ensures the installation of the new version. Listing packages on each line can also prevent mistakes in package duplication. In addition, when you clean up the apt cache by removing/var/lib/apt/listsit reduces the image size, since the apt cache isn't stored in a layer. Since theRUNstatement starts withapt-get update, the package cache is always refreshed prior toapt-get install. Official Debian and Ubuntu imagesautomatically runapt-get clean, so explicit invocation is not required. SomeRUNcommands depend on the ability to pipe the output of one command into another, using the pipe character (|), as in the following example: Docker executes these commands using the/bin/sh -cinterpreter, which only evaluates the exit code of the last operation in the pipe to determine success. In the example above, this build step succeeds and produces a new image so long as thewc -lcommand succeeds, even if thewgetcommand fails. If you want the command to fail due to an error at any stage in the pipe, prependset -o pipefail &&to ensure that an unexpected error prevents the build from inadvertently succeeding. For example:"

TheENVinstruction is also useful for providing the required environment variables specific to services you want to containerize, such as Postgres’sPGDATA. Lastly,ENVcan also be used to set commonly used version numbers so that version bumps are easier to maintain, as seen in the following example: Similar to having constant variables in a program, as opposed to hard-coding values, this approach lets you change a singleENVinstruction to automatically bump the version of the software in your container. EachENVline creates a new intermediate layer, just likeRUNcommands. This means that even if you unset the environment variable in a future layer, it still persists in this layer and its value can be dumped. You can test this by creating a Dockerfile like the following, and then building it. To prevent this, and really unset the environment variable, use aRUNcommand with shell commands, to set, use, and unset the variable all in a single layer. You can separate your commands with;or&&. If you use the second method, and one of the commands fails, thedocker buildalso fails. This is usually a good idea. Using\\as a line continuation character for Linux Dockerfiles improves readability. You could also put all of the commands into a shell script and have theRUNcommand just run that shell script.
