    "### Explanation of Changes:",
    "",
    "1. **Combined RUN Commands & Used --no-install-recommends**",
    "   - Specific Changes: Combined the `apt-get update` and `apt-get install` into a single `RUN` command, included `--no-install-recommends`, and added `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` to clean up the cache.",
    "   - Linter Issues Addressed: Pin package versions, use `--no-install-recommends`, and clean up apt cache.",
    "   - Benefits: Reduced the image size and number of layers by combining commands. Using `--no-install-recommends` minimizes storage footprint by installing only essential packages.",
    "",
    "2. **Pin Package Versions**",
    "   - Specific Changes: Added specific versions for `curl` and `vim-tiny` based on the current Debian Bullseye repository as of the latest updates.",
    "   - Linter Issues Addressed: Pin package versions.",
    "   - Benefits: Enhances build reproducibility and stability, ensuring consistent builds over time.",
    "",
    "3. **Added Labels for Metadata**",
    "   - Specific Changes: Introduced `LABEL` instructions to include image metadata like maintainer, version, and description.",
    "   - Best Practices Addressed: Use of `LABEL` for metadata.",
    "   - Benefits: Makes managing and organizing Docker images easier with essential information embedded within the image.",
    "",
    "4. **Use of Non-Root User**",
    "   - Specific Changes: Created a non-root user `appuser` and switched to it using the `USER` instruction.",
    "   - Linter Issues Addressed: Use a non-root user.",
    "   - Benefits: Increased security by minimizing the privileges assigned to processes running within the container.",
    "",
    "5. **Adjusted COPY Command with Ownership**",
    "   - Specific Changes: Used the `COPY --chown=appuser:appuser` to ensure file ownership is assigned to the non-root user.",
    "   - Best Practices Addressed: Assign correct file permissions proactively.",
    "   - Benefits: Ensures files are accessible to the non-root user, reinforcing container security measures.",
    "",
    "Each change collectively contributes to reducing the image size, improving security, and ensuring adherence to Docker best practices and linter recommendations."
