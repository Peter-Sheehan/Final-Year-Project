    "### Explanation of Changes:",
    "",
    "1. **Use of Multi-Stage Builds**:",
    "   - Introduced a `builder` stage named using `AS builder`.",
    "   - This technique allows us to build the application dependencies in a separate stage and only copy the necessary files to the final image, significantly reducing the final image size.",
    "   - Addresses linter recommendation to use named stages for multi-stage builds.",
    "",
    "2. **Switch to `python:3.9-slim`**:",
    "   - Changed the base image to `python:3.9-slim`, which is smaller than the default `python:3.9`.",
    "   - This helps reduce the final image size and addresses the linter warning about choosing a minimal base image for better performance.",
    "",
    "3. **Environment Variables**:",
    "   - Added `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` to prevent writing `.pyc` files and to ensure output is not buffered, improving performance and debugging.",
    "   - Helps in maintaining a clean environment suitable for Docker.",
    "",
    "4. **Non-Root User**:",
    "   - Created and switched to a non-root user `myapp` for running the application.",
    "   - This enhances the security of the application by following the principle of least privilege, addressing critical linter issues.",
    "",
    "5. **Efficient `pip install`**:",
    "   - Combined `pip install` into a single command using a `requirements.txt` file.",
    "   - Added `--no-cache-dir` to prevent the accumulation of cache files, further reducing the image size.",
    "",
    "6. **COPY statement optimization**:",
    "   - Grouped the `COPY` commands and used a staged build to transfer only the necessary files to the final image.",
    "   - This optimizes layer creation and keeps the final image lightweight.",
    "",
    "7. **Consistent use of `WORKDIR`**:",
    "   - Ensured that `WORKDIR /app` is consistently used across the Dockerfile stages to maintain directory context.",
    "",
    "By implementing these changes, the Dockerfile becomes more efficient, secure, and maintainable according to recommended best practices."
