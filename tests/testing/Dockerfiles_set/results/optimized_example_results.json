    "### Explanation of Changes:",
    "",
    "1. **Use of `--user` for Pip Installations**:",
    "   - **Change Made**: Instead of installing packages globally with `pip`, switch to user-level installation using `--user` flag.",
    "   - **Addressed Best Practice**: Helps in maintaining a cleaner file system and avoids modifying the global site-packages.",
    "   - **Benefits**: User-level installations isolate dependencies, improving security by not requiring root permissions for package installations.",
    "",
    "2. **Path Update for User-level Package Binaries**:",
    "   - **Change Made**: Added `ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH` to ensure user-level binaries are in the execution path.",
    "   - **Addressed Best Practice**: Ensures that the installed packages can be executed without requiring full paths.",
    "   - **Benefits**: Simplifies running installed binaries and adheres to practices of updating PATH for new executables.",
    "",
    "3. **Cleanup of Library Path Copying**:",
    "   - **Change Made**: Changed the directories copied from the builder to the app layer to the user library directory `/root/.local` instead of system-wide `/usr/local/lib`.",
    "   - **Addressed Best Practice**: Maintains the encapsulation of user-level deployments.",
    "   - **Benefits**: Ensures that only necessary user-level libraries are copied, reducing complexity and avoiding unnecessary system-wide changes.",
    "",
    "This optimized Dockerfile ensures an effective separation and organization of build artifacts, uses system resources optimally, and keeps security measures to prevent unnecessary elevation of privileges during runtime, all while following Docker best practices."
