    "### Explanation of Changes:",
    "",
    "1. **Multi-stage Build Implementation**:",
    "   - Introduced a two-stage build process: `builder` stage and `final` stage.",
    "   - The first stage (`builder`) installs necessary build dependencies and sets up the application directory.",
    "   - The second stage (`final`) copies the contents from the builder stage.",
    "   - **Addresses**: Linter issue regarding multi-stage builds.",
    "   - **Benefits**: Reduces the final image size by not including build dependencies in the runtime stage, thus producing a cleaner and leaner deployment image.",
    "",
    "2. **Separate Dependencies Installation**:",
    "   - Moved the `RUN apk add --no-cache curl` to only the builder stage.",
    "   - **Addresses**: Best practices of not installing unnecessary packages in the final image.",
    "   - **Benefits**: Excludes build-only dependencies from the production image, reducing potential vulnerabilities and keeping the production environment cleaner.",
    "",
    "3. **WORKDIR Placement**:",
    "   - Added `WORKDIR /app` in each stage appropriately to prevent directory context issues.",
    "   - **Addresses**: Consistent use of `WORKDIR` for clarity and avoiding directory paths.",
    "   - **Benefits**: Ensures stability and correctness by setting the working directory at the start of both copying processes and CMD execution.",
    "",
    "4. **Efficient COPY Usage**:",
    "   - Updated `COPY . /app` to `COPY --from=builder /app /app` and `COPY . .` to eliminate duplicate copy operations between stages.",
    "   - **Addresses**: Proper use of `COPY` in multi-stage builds.",
    "   - **Benefits**: Ensures only necessary files for runtime are included, improving build efficiency as well as maintenance clarity.",
    "",
    "5. **Maintaining the Original Functionality**:",
    "   - Ensured the application runs as intended by retaining the `CMD` and user settings.",
    "   - **Addresses**: CMD and USER practices for Docker.",
    "   - **Benefits**: Keeps the final container lightweight and secures by running as a non-root user without altering original functionality."
