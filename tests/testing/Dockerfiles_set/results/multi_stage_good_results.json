    "### Explanation of Changes:",
    "",
    "1. **Consolidate RUN Commands in Builder Stage:**",
    "   - Combined the two `RUN` instructions into a single command in the builder stage.",
    "   - This reduces the number of layers and improves build speed, addressing best practices for layer management and maximizing build cache usage.",
    "",
    "2. **Optimize Pip Install with No-Index:**",
    "   - Added `--no-index --find-links=/wheels` flags to the `pip install` command in the production stage.",
    "   - This enforces that pip only uses the wheels generated previously, improving security and ensuring a consistent environment by not reaching out to external repositories.",
    "",
    "3. **Minimal Image with Additional Library:**",
    "   - Added `apk add --no-cache libc6-compat` to the production stage.",
    "   - `libc6-compat` is sometimes necessary for compatibility with Python wheels that might depend on GNU C libraries, reducing potential runtime issues.",
    "",
    "4. **Specific Shell Assignment for Non-root User:**",
    "   - Modified `adduser` to specify a shell, using `-s /bin/sh` to define the available shell for `appuser`.",
    "   - Enhances security by explicitly defining user characteristics and preventing login errors related to default shell settings.",
    "",
    "5. **Label Addition:**",
    "   - Considered but did not add `LABEL` as there wasn't a specific use case or requirement stated in the context.",
    "   - Remained unchanged unless explicitly needed for organization or automation purposes to comply with best practices for intended labeling benefits. ",
    "",
    "6. **General Structure and Comments:**",
    "   - Refined the overall structure, ensuring clarity by adding segment headers for clear separation of build and production stages.",
    "   - Structural clarity aids maintainability, even though not explicitly listed in the optimization context. ",
    "",
    "These changes optimize the Dockerfile to build a smaller, potentially more secure, and efficient image following Docker best practices."
